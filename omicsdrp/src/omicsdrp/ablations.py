"""Stage-1 ablation grid.

One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) around a reference config, which is the standard way
to attribute a performance change to a single design choice. Groups:

  * ``omics``   -- omics ablation by NOISE substitution: all 15 non-empty subsets
                   of the 4 modalities, capacity held constant (see below).
  * ``encoder`` -- attention vs. plain MLP cell encoder.
  * ``drug``    -- drug representation. The default grid compares only the
                   **frozen-representation** family (morgan baseline + the 4
                   pretrained encoders): every one is "fixed representation ->
                   trained projection head", an apples-to-apples comparison.
                   The end-to-end GNNs (gin/gcn) are intentionally EXCLUDED --
                   they train the drug encoder jointly, so "how much of the gap
                   is representation vs. extra trainable capacity" is ill-defined
                   as a fair ablation. (They remain implemented and can still be
                   run manually via an explicit config.)
  * ``split``   -- mixed / unseen-cell / unseen-drug evaluation regimes.

``build_grid(groups=...)`` lets the runner pick which groups to execute so the
"skeleton today, run sequentially later" workflow can be scoped per session.

# modality ablations become possible (dropping to one column collapsed the cell
# branch). Hence the full power set: all 15 non-empty noise subsets of the 4
